         <p>
            A python application which plays a certain type of music based on user's emotion.
            <ul>
                <li> 
                  The goal of this application is to help users enhance their mood by playing a certain type of music/joke when they are alone or driving.
                </li>

                <li>  
                  Detects user's facial expressions to track their current mood. Based on their mood, it plays a certain type of music to calm them down. The ultimate goal is to avoid chances of road rage by keeping the surrounding environment to the user's liking.
                </li>

                <li> 
                  Used OpenCV library to detect live frame of the user's frontal face. This frame is passed to the pre-learned tensorflow model, to figure out the user's mood. This information is continuously tracked to gauge a better understanding of user's emotion. Based on the data gathered, specific type of music/joke is played to lighten user's mood.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

      <p> Facial expression and current name of the song is displayed. While the current song is playing, the application gathers data about user's overall mood to select an appropriate preceding song.
